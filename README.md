# SQL_and_Pandas
A series of query exercises solved with SQL (postgres) and Python's Pandas module. I created this because I wanted to
practice using both languages for queries and also compare the methodology and ease of either method to execute any particular query.

The query exercises come from PostgreSQL Exercises was made by Alisdair Owens (https://www.pgexercises.com/). You can download the queried database from there.

I go through these exercises using Jupyter Notebook. Using the code in the notebooks, you will be able to
use psycopg and pandas to convert the database into a pandas dataframe. The output from the notebook cells are
in pandas, though you could easily use psycopg to run the queries in SQL within the notebooks.
